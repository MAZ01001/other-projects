> A Windows console Snake game which's written in C++
>
> + Compile (with MinGW) → `g++ .\snake_cmd-game.cpp -o .\run`
> + Start (in Windows-cmd) → `.\run.exe -t 200 -p`
>   + Extra flags:
>     + `-t 100` ← Sets the millisecond delay between each frame/calculation. Default is 200.
>     + `-p` ← Will enable "portal walls" which makes the snake reappear on the other side instead of game over.
>   + Other keys and what they do, like `[wasd] move` are on-screen underneath the game.
>   + The playable field is default 30*30 cells big. Wich is only changeable before compiling.
